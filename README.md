# ðŸŸ¢ Unraid Release Watcher

A lightweight Docker service that polls the official Unraid announcements feed and notifies you via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) when:

1. A new **stable Unraid OS release** is announced (beta/rc/pre/alpha excluded).  
2. The current stable release has been out for a configurable number of days (default **30**) â€” reminding you itâ€™s time to update.
